				<p>With a shattered canopy and 20mm shell holes through his wing, flap and fuselage, the 47th Squadron’s Lieutenant Sher was miraculously unhurt as he coaxed his P-51 toward Iwo. After seven hours and 35 minutes of flying he still didn’t fully appreciate the extent of the damage as he made a cautious approach to Runway 5. He remembered: “My tail wheel wouldn’t come down, but I didn’t realize that and was trying a three point landing on only two points. However, I didn’t have enough wing area left and stalled out too early. All I could do was bury the nose in the ground. The Mustang pitched up vertically but didn’t go over and flopped back down, breaking its spine.”</p>

				<p>As the weeks passed and Japanese aerial resistance began to diminish, VII Fighter Command was ordered to concentrate on airfield strikes. Tactical procedure dictated that one squadron remained as high cover while the others thundered down, full throttle, line abreast, to sweep the enemy field with .50-caliber fire. But as in a cavalry charge, some Mustangs outpaced others and could be seen later in gun camera shots. Captain Felix Scott, 46th Squadron, described one such hell-for-leather assault: “We were down in the treetops strafing when part of the 15th Group came through us. We were dodging P-51s, tracers and land mines all at the same time. The mines looked like dish pans floating in the air. The Japs were always late in firing them and they ended up behind us.”</p>

				<p>The month of July saw 17 such sweeps and not a single high-altitude escort job. Tough as the air-to-air encounters often proved to be, the pilots preferred them to low-level strafing missions. Lieutenant Hank Ryniker, 47th Squadron, recalled one mission that claimed two 15th Fighter Group planes and pilots: “We came across Tokyo Bay from the east, dropping down because of rain and clouds until finally we were orbiting at 2,000 feet, low and slow over the heaviest flak area I’ve ever seen. Amid heavy flak bursts and tracers I heard fellows call in, ‘I’m hit,’ ‘My coolant’s shot out,’ ‘My rudders are jammed,’ and I felt cold fear. We encountered no fighters, just flak. You could see, fight and kill fighters, but there’s nothing so futile as a wall of flak.”</p>
